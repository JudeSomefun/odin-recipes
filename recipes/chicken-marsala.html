        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken marsala has grown to be one of my favorite dishes.  It has such versatility as a dish.  It could be an entree served with rice or potatoes or even as a side platter.</p> 
        <p>Also, it doesnt hurt that it is so easy to make with very few ingredients and little prep time.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Garlic salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Dried oregano</li>
            <li>Skinless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Marsala wine</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour, garlic salt, pepper, and oregano together in a bowl. Dredge chicken in flour mixture until lightly coated.</li>
            <li>Heat oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Flip chicken and add mushrooms. Cook, stirring mushrooms occasionally, until chicken is browned on the other side, about 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour Marsala wine over chicken. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
